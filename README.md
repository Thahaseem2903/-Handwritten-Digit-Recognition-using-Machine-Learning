Hand written digit recognization project using Machine Learning
Handwritten digit recognition using machine learning refers to the process of automatically identifying and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from a given dataset. It is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

The typical workflow for handwritten digit recognition involves the following steps:

Dataset Preparation: A large collection of handwritten digits is required to train and evaluate the machine learning model. This dataset is typically divided into two subsets: a training set and a testing/validation set.

Data Preprocessing: The raw input images of handwritten digits are preprocessed to enhance the quality and simplify the data. This may involve steps such as resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.

Feature Extraction: In this step, meaningful features are extracted from the preprocessed images to represent the characteristics of the digits. Common techniques for feature extraction in digit recognition include edge detection, contour extraction, and histogram-based methods.

Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms can be employed to train a model on the preprocessed and extracted features. Popular algorithms for handwritten digit recognition include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model learns from the training dataset by adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the prediction error.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing/validation dataset to assess its performance. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are common evaluation metrics used in digit recognition.

Prediction: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the class labels of unseen handwritten digits. The model takes an input image, applies the same preprocessing and feature extraction steps as during training, and then makes a prediction based on the learned patterns.

Deployment: The trained model can be deployed in real-world applications, such as mobile apps or online services, to recognize handwritten digits from user input.
