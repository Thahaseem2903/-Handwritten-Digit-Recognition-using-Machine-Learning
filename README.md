Project Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for recognizing handwritten digits. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

Project Overview
Handwritten digit recognition is an important problem in the field of pattern recognition and computer vision. The ability to accurately classify handwritten digits has numerous applications, such as postal mail sorting, automated form processing, and digitizing historical documents.

In this project, we employ a machine learning approach to tackle the task of handwritten digit recognition. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a large collection of labeled handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset.

Project Highlights
Utilizes the MNIST dataset: The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). It serves as a standard benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of machine learning models on handwritten digit recognition.

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture: The model is built using a CNN, which is a powerful deep learning architecture for processing and classifying images. CNNs are known for their ability to capture spatial patterns and hierarchical features, making them well-suited for tasks like digit recognition.

Training and evaluation: The model is trained on the training set of the MNIST dataset using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. The performance of the model is evaluated on the separate testing set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.

Performance metrics: The model's performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify handwritten digits.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

Set up the development environment: Install the required libraries and dependencies, such as Python, TensorFlow, and NumPy.

Download the MNIST dataset: Obtain the MNIST dataset, which includes both the training and testing sets of handwritten digit images.

Preprocess the data: Perform necessary preprocessing steps on the dataset, such as resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Train the model: Build and train the CNN model using the training set. Tune the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, for optimal performance.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the trained model on the testing set and calculate the performance metrics to assess its accuracy.

Predict on new images: Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the labels of new, unseen handwritten digit images.

Conclusion

Handwritten digit recognition is a challenging yet fascinating problem that can be effectively addressed using machine learning techniques
